# Matt Anderson

I am a student at Indian River State College, majoring in Information Technology and Cybersecurity.  
I am currently studying for CompTIA A+ as a way to learn the basics of networking and better understand what I am protecting.

My technical experience includes programming languages such as Python, C++, C, SQL, PowerShell, and Bash.  
I maintain a homelab where I conduct projects related to server management and configuration, hypervisor management, network engineering, malware analysis, and penetration testing.
